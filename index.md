     I already set up vs code in last quarter when taking CSE 11, so I can't show you how to install it, but you can easily download it at [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
* **Step 2**\
Remote Connect

Before doing this,I first changed my password through [Account Lookup](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php).

    *It actually took me lots of efforts to set it up*:(
    
    After that, I opened the termianl and typed in
    >ssh cs15lwi22avn@ieng6.ucsd.edu> 

    Then I was able to enter the password and successfuly connect to the server.
* **Step 3**\
Run Commands

    >ls -a

    This  command allows us to see all the files and folders in the server.
