                    How did I find the two different results?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Following the instructions in lab 9, I first stored all the results generated by the 
                    implementation of MarkdownParse provided in lab 9 in results.txt. Then, I stored the results generated by
                     my implementation in results1.txt. As shown in the image, I used diff to compare these two files and found 
                     a great number of different results.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Among all, I picked test-files/201.md and test-files/500.md (for convenience, they will be 
                    called Test 201 and Test 500 respectively).

                <p>Therefore, it's clearly that the given implementation is wrong while mine is correct, 
                    since there're no real link in this file. </p>
                <p>The easy way to fix this bug is to add a condition to check the distance between them</p>

                <p>The reason my implementation failed this one is that I tried to detect "!" 
                    before the open bracket to determine if this is a image, 
                    but I set the wrong condition so it misses the first link.  </p>

                   <p> The annotated codes are the original code. Under them are the fix. </p>
                   <p> Before, when open bracket is at 0, the link followed it just got missed.
                       Now, it will still be included in the list.
